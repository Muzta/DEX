This is a decentralized exchange, deployed on Sepolia network, that allows swapping ETH <> Token

It has been done following this [LearnWeb3 tutorial](https://learnweb3.io/degrees/ethereum-developer-degree/sophomore/build-your-own-decentralized-exchange-like-uniswap-v1/) for learning purposes. 

The requirements of this project are:
- Build an exchange that allows swapping ETH <> TOKEN
- DEX must charge a 1% fee on swaps
- When user adds liquidity, they must be given an LP Token that represents their share of the pool
- LP must be able to burn their LP tokens to receive back ETH and TOKEN
